Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up for local development.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:Cyber-Mint/py_app_package.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ python3 -m venv ./py_app_package 
    $ cd ./py_app_package
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install -e .

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes
   pass the test cases, fixup your PEP8 compliance,
   and check for any code style issues:

    $ pip3 install tox autopep8 flake8 black
    $ tox
    $ autopep8 -r -i app
    $ flake8 app
    $ python -m black app

   To get autopep8 and black, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release Tag"
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature --follow-tags
    

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in CHANGELOG.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8+

Publish to PyPi
---------------

Some notes on publishing to PyPi. Always publish to testpypi first!

    $ rm -rf dist/ build/
    $ git status   #to make sure you have committed the latest version
    $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    $ twine check dist/*
    $ python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose


Tips
----

To run the tests::

$ tox


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.

1. Update CHANGELOG.rst with the intended release number Z.Y.X and commit to git.

2. Bump the version number X.Y.Z in setup.py according to Major.Minor.Patch::

    $ git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Initial commit"

3. Push the release commit and new tag up::

       $ git push --follow-tags

4. Th CI tool (once you have set one up) should automatically deploy the 
   tagged release to PyPI if the automated tests pass.

Publishing to PyPi
------------------

First perform all your tests on test.pypi.org by registering there.
The create a token and save it safely somewhere.

    # After the build steps above you may upload your dist/* files
    # CHANGELOG and setup.py are the only two files which refer to a version.

    $ python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose
    # this will ask you for a username: enter __token__
    # and it will ask for a password: paste the long token string(in full)
    
Testing the install will require the sue of specifying the testpypi repo  
as follows::

    sudo pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ py-app-package

This will fetch the depdendencies from the main pypi repo and your package from the specified pypi repo.
